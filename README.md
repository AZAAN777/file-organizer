# Python File Organizer

This is a simple Python script that organizes files in a folder by their **file types** (extensions). It creates separate folders like `PDF`, `TXT`, `JPG`, etc., and moves each file into its respective folder.

## Features

- Organizes files by extension automatically
- Creates folders for each type (e.g., `PDF`, `MP4`, `NO_EXTENSION`)
- Handles hidden files and files without extensions
- Skips duplicates to avoid overwriting
